# Example of custom validators
This folder contains a web app written in AngularJS and build with Webpack.
It has two validators.

* `dateFormat`
* `minValue`

The `dateFormat` validator uses a `dateFormatService` to get the correct format.

The `minValue` validator validates against another value in the view model.
